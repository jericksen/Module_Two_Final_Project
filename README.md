# Module Two Final Project

By: Jonathan Ericksen
For: Northwind

### Background:
>Northwind is a small company looking to gain critical insights provided by the data housed within their data warehouse. Northwind is looking to make strategic moves based on insights gleaned from the data. As a small company, their reserouces are limited, thus, Northwind has contracted with JE Consulting to analyze the data and perform a number of statistical tests answering key questions posed by management.

### Objective:
>The objective for JE Consulting is to extract the necessary data from their SQL based database and perform four statistical tests that determine with confidence whether or not previous, non-data driven assumptions about their operations, are indeed correct. 

>The results of these tests will be used by the management team to assess future strategies for improving revenue growth and improving overall operational efficiency. These tests will direct  company resources towards yielding the highest return on companies capital. The conclusions of these tests, and the implications for Northwind, will be summarized in the 'Conclusions' portion of the notebook. 

>Last, JE Consulting was asked to provide recommendations for further work as they continue to seek areas for further statistical analysis. JE Consulting will provide these recommendations in the 'Future Work' portion of the notebook. 

### Hypothesis Testing:
#### Hypothesis Test #1:
Do discounts have a statistically significant effect on the number of products customers order? If so, at what level(s) of discount?
#### Hypothesis Test #2:
Is the average order size in North America larger than international order sizes?
#### Hypothesis Test #3:
Does order size vary in a statistically signficant way between Northwind employees?
#### Hypothesis Test #4:
Does the average revenue per order differ in 2014 from 2012 & 2013?

### The following is a summation of our findings :

#### Test One (Discounts):

Do discounts have a statistically significant effect on the number of products customers order? If so, at what level(s) of discount?
Conclusion One:

Part One: Yes, discounts do have a significant impact on the number of products ordered. Not only do they increase the number of products ordered, but we can say the impact of applying disounts is signficant.

Part Two: Generally, discounts have signficantly impact the number of products ordered at most levels with the exception of discounts at the 10% level.

#### Test Two (Efficiency):

Is the average order size in North America larger than international order sizes?
Conclusion Two:

Order sizes in North America are indeed higher on average than international order sizes. The impact on order size between domestic and foriegn shipping is significant.

#### Test Three (Employees):

Does order size vary in a statistically signficant way between Northwind employees?
Conclusion Three:

There seems to be no statistically significant variation in the average size per order between Northwind employees.

#### Test Four (Revenue):

Does the average revenue per order differ in 2014 from 2012 & 2013?
Conclusion Four:

The average revenue per order does not vary from 2014 to 2012 & 2013. In fact, it appears revenue per order decreases slightly from 2014 to 2012 & 2013. However, we cannot accept this conclusion with confidence.
